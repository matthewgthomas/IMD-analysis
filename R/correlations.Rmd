# Correlations between English sub-domains

Statistically significant negative correlation between the two sub-domains of the 'barriers to housing and services' domain: geographical barriers and wider barriers:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
imd_england_lsoa_subdomains |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = Geographical_barriers_rank, y = Wider_barriers_rank)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```
